# fast.fhog
Implementation for:
Polceanu M., Harrouet F., Buche C., "Fast Multi-Scale fHOG Feature Extraction Using Histogram Downsampling", RoboCup International Symposium, 2018.

-----------
Information
-----------

This code uses a modified version of Dlib 19.4 (http://dlib.net/) which is included in this repository.

The training and testing datasets are included. Images are obtained from multiple sources, including the SPQR dataset (http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~labrococo/?q=node/459).

Level up to which scheme is applied is hard-coded to 7 in dlib-19.4-modified/dlib/image_processing/scan_fhog_pyramid.h line:928 ([link to line](https://github.com/polceanum/fast.fhog/blob/master/dlib-19.4-modified/dlib/image_processing/scan_fhog_pyramid.h#L928)) (sorry, research code...). After changes, the library must be recompiled.

Other parameters are found in the same file as above, at lines 685-693.

Configurations:

Original baseline:
* set USE_HACK to 0

Power law (Dollar et al. 2014):
* set USE_HACK to 1
* set hybridLevel to 10

Paper results:
* set USE_HACK to 1
* set hybridLevel to values between 2 and 9

Note: Average precision on the testing dataset will be lower than those reported in the paper. Results from the paper were obtained by doing a hyperparameter search at each level. This implementation has hardcoded hyperparameters and is only optimized for the original baseline.
